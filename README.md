# Python 3.x:
The program is written in Python 3 and requires a Python 3 interpreter to execute properly.
# Basic Understanding of Cipher Techniques:
The program implements two classical cipher techniques: the Vigenère Cipher (a polyalphabetic cipher) and the Polybius Cipher (a cipher based on a 5x5 grid of letters).
# No External Dependencies:
The code does not require any third-party libraries. It uses only Python's built-in functions.
# Input Format:
For Vigenère Cipher, the user should input a string of uppercase letters and a keyword (also in uppercase).
For Polybius Cipher, the string should consist of uppercase letters (no special characters or lowercase letters).
# Operating System:
The program is platform-independent and will run on any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) with Python 3.x installed.

# Demo:
# Encryption and Decryption with Vigenère and Polybius Ciphers
# Vigenère Cipher Encryption:
Input: The user provides a string (e.g., "HELLO") and a keyword (e.g., "KEY").
Process: The program generates a key matching the length of the string and encrypts the string using the Vigenère cipher.
Output: The encrypted text (ciphertext) is shown, e.g., "RIJVS".
# Vigenère Cipher Decryption:
Input: The program uses the generated key to decrypt the ciphertext back to the original string.
Output: The original (decrypted) text is displayed, e.g., "HELLO".
# Polybius Cipher Encryption:
Input: The user enters a string (e.g., "HELLO").
Process: Each character is converted into coordinates based on its position in a 5x5 Polybius square.
Output: The encrypted Polybius cipher coordinates are shown, e.g., 23 5 12 12 15.
# Key Generation (for Vigenère Cipher):
Function: A key is generated by repeating the keyword until it matches the length of the input string.
Polybius Square:
Structure: The Polybius square consists of a 5x5 grid of letters (excluding 'J' or treating it as 'I').
Output: Each letter in the string is mapped to a row and column number.
